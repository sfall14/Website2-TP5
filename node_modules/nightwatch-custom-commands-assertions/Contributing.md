So, you want to add you command or assertion. Great!

Read [this guide](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#extending) on how to write it.
The name you give to the file will be the name of the command or assertion.

Then:

- checkout the repository
- start writing your command in the `es6/commands` folder or your assertion in the `es6/assertions` folder
- run `npm install -g gulp`
- run `npm install` in the root folder
- run `gulp`
- make a pull request
